I work as a postdoctoral researcher of mathematics at the Weierstrass Institute, in Berlin, Germany. My main topics of research fall under the umbrella of partial differential equations, control, optimization, and numerical analysis. I love working with experts from different fields and contributing to the exciting advancements in applied mathematics that impact science and engineering.

I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Memphis under the mentorship of Profs. Irena Lasiecka and Roberto Triggiani where I also enjoyed teaching for almost four years. My dissertation was about the boundary feedback stabilization of a critical third-order (in time) semilinear acoustic wave equation, motivated by the cool tech behind high-intensity focused ultrasound. With a decent grasp of Python, I'm passionate about taking on complex mathematical challenges and helping push the boundaries of applied mathematics.
